# The Scripter
## Your SQL Scripter

- Are you bored to change the same scripts over and over?
- Do you spend un-necessary time looking for variables buried in the script?
- Would you like to minimise the damage human error could cause?

If you said yes to any of the above, keep reading as this simple app is just what you need.

## What does this WebApp do?

1. The app generates a form from pre-set variables found in one or more .SQL files.
2. You can then use the form to fill the script(s)
3. A .Zip file is generated with all your scripts ready to be applied in the database.
